The Lightweight Support Ticket Management System provides a centralized platform where every support request is logged as a ticket with a unique ID, assigned priority, agent, and lifecycle status. The system ensures transparency, accountability, and systematic problem-solving without the complexity of a backend server. 

# 🎫 Lightweight Support Ticket Management System

This project addresses the problem of unstructured and untracked support requests in organizations. Support issues often arrive through emails, messages, or verbal communication, making it difficult to track ownership, status, and resolution history.

The Lightweight Support Ticket Management System provides a centralized and structured solution where every issue is logged as a ticket and tracked through its complete lifecycle.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Support requests are received from multiple channels without a unified tracking system. As a result, issues are frequently forgotten, repeatedly followed up on, or left unresolved, leading to inefficiency and user frustration.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The system converts every support request into a ticket with a unique ticket ID, assigned priority, agent, and status. Users receive confirmation after ticket submission and are informed that an agent will be assigned soon. Support agents can track, update, and resolve tickets through a centralized dashboard.
